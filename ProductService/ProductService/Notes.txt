To run mongo server:
    mongod --dbpath /Users/meghaukkali/mongodb-data

In a distributed system, whenever a service makes synchronous call to another service, there will be always 
a case of risks associated with it may be it is network outages, hardware failures, deployment in progress.

so, it's our responsibility as a SD to make sure the system to be resilient in such cases.

Solution would be:
1. setting up timeouts (helps the system being more responsive) but also system should retry( retrying using Polly 
    with exponential back off) before sending timeout failure to client.
    Exponential back off: requests are sent to another service in such way that there will be time gap 
        between each request like 2,4,8
2. using Circuit breaker.
